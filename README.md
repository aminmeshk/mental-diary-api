# Mental Diary API
A simple CRUD RESTful API for my Mental Diary project

## Using:
- Node JS
- Express JS
- TypeScript
- Sequelize (as my ORM) (I didn't know about Prisma, might change to that at some point)
- PostgreSQL (as my database)

## P.S: 
This is my first API project trying out Node JS so don't expect too much :))
